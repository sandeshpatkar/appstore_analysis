    "We analyzed more than 15,000 apps from both the app stores in order to identify a free app whose main income source would be in-app ads. Looking at the data from both the stores, an app in the books category would be a good choice for us. In this category, not all apps are dominated by big companies like we saw in communication and video player genre. In fact, the 100 million and 10 million app install bracket is dominated by apps based on holy books. Add to this the fact that this category is also better suited for Apple AppStore, we should go ahead with an app in this category but with better features."
